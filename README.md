other stuff to do:

- check out `vagrant ssh-config` to get the path to the `IdentityFile` vagrant is using, if you're not using your own key.
- if moving your boxes to a USB, follow steps [like this](https://emptysqua.re/blog/moving-virtualbox-and-vagrant-to-an-external-drive/)
    - change VirtualBox preferences to reflect the move as well preferences > general > default machine folder
